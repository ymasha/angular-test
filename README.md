## Functionality Requirements

Create a timer component that decreases the count by 1 every second.

The component has the following functionalities:

- The timer value decreases by 1 every second. For example, if the initial value is 100, after 1 second it becomes 99, after 1 more second it becomes 98, and so on.
- The timer value starts decreasing right after the component is mounted.
- The initial value of the timer is set by a prop `initial` passed down to the component.
- Once the counter value becomes 0, it should not decrease further.
- The button `Stop Timer` stops the timer at the current value. For example, if the initial value was 120, and the button is pressed at 110, the timer stops at value 110.
 
## Testing Requirements

The following data-test-id attributes are required in the component for the tests to pass:

- The timer value should have the data-test-id attribute `timer-value`.
- The `Stop Timer` button should have the data-test-id attribute `stop-button`.

Please note that the component has the above data-test-id attributes for test cases and certain classes and ids for rendering purposes. It is advised not to change them.
